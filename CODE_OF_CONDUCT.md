# NextRec Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We strive to make NextRec a welcoming, harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. All participants—maintainers, contributors, sponsors, and users—are expected to help create a positive environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy, patience, and respect in all interactions
- Offering and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Giving credit where it is due and acknowledging the work of others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or any sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, code review, documentation, community chat channels, meetups, and any other public or private communication related to NextRec.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at `zyaztec@gmail.com` or by opening a private issue directed to the maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter and will keep details of the incident as confidential as possible.
